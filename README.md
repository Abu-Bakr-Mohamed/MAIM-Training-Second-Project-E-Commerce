# MAIM-Training-Second-Project-E-Commerce
This is the second project I was asked to create while training with MAIM


This project is a website consisting of multiple pages, All HTML files are in the root directory, all CSS files have their own folder, and the same for JS files
To run this code, you have to open the index.html file, after that, u will be directed to the landing page.
You can now navigate to other pages from there.

Note: the code is well structured and has many comments to explain itself, it doesnâ€™t need a specific explanation.
