# MAIM-Training-Second-Project-E-Commerce
This is the second project I was asked to create while training with MAIM


This project is a website consisting of multiple pages, each page has its own folder, in which there are three files, HTML, CSS, and JS file.
Note that the landing page (the main page) doesn’t have its folder, it is put directly in the root of the project folder to make it easier for the browser to find the index.html file.
To run this code, you have to open the index.html file, after that, u will be directed to the landing page.
You can now navigate to other pages from there.

Note: the code is well structured and has many comments to explain itself, it doesn’t need a specific explanation.
